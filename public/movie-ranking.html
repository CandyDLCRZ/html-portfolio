<h1>The Best Netflix Series According to Katrin Erika</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite Netflix Series of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bridgerton</h3>
<p>
This series if very chic. I love the dresses, the jewelries and the hairstyles worn by the actresses.
I also love how all the actors portrayed their respective roles. My favorite ofcourse is Daphne Bridgerton and her screen partner, The Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset.

<h3>The Crown</h3>
<p>
I love this series. It brings back so many memories about the British Royal Family. 
I am always fascinated about how the Monarchy works and on how King & Queens, Prince & Princesses actually live their lives. 
Although they say that The Crown is just a fiction and not based on real life, but watching this somehow gives you a glimpse of how living as a Royal would look like.

<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>
Now this one is different from the first 2 series I've mentioned above. It is an American Series about Corporate lawyers in Manhattan.
I love this show because its really funny and the actors are very good in portraying their roles.
